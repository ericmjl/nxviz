# Gotchas

## Private variables are cell-scoped

Variables with a `_` prefix are **private to the cell that defines them** in
marimo. They cannot be referenced from other cells — you'll get a `NameError`.

This matters when building notebooks programmatically. A common mistake:

```python
# Cell A
_df = pd.DataFrame(results)   # _df is private to this cell

# Cell B — FAILS
mo.ui.table(_df)               # NameError: name '_df' is not defined
```

**Fix:** Either merge both into one cell, or use a non-private name (`df`).

## Duplicate public imports across cells

marimo enforces single-definition: a public name (like `pd`) can only be
defined in one cell. If two cells both `import pandas as pd`, you get a
`Multiply-defined names` error at validation.

**Fix:** Use a `_` prefix on the second import (`import pandas as _pd`) or
consolidate imports into a shared cell.

## `inspect.getsource()` on methods is indented

`inspect.getsource()` on a class method preserves the original indentation.
Passing this to `ast.parse()` fails with `IndentationError`.

```python
# FAILS
src = inspect.getsource(SomeClass.some_method)
tree = ast.parse(src)  # IndentationError: unexpected indent

# FIX
import textwrap
src = textwrap.dedent(inspect.getsource(SomeClass.some_method))
tree = ast.parse(src)
```

## Cached module availability

Some libraries cache optional-dependency availability at import time. Installing
a package mid-session via `ctx.packages.add()` won't update those caches.
The user may need to restart the kernel — but try known workarounds first.

### Polars + pyarrow

`df.to_pandas()` fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: pa.Table requires 'pyarrow'`.

**Workaround** — if this error occurs after installing pyarrow mid-session,
run the following via `execute-code` (scratchpad), NOT in a cell. The patch
mutates the cached module object in the running kernel, so it doesn't need to
persist in the notebook.

```python
import pyarrow as _pa
import polars.dataframe.frame as _frame_mod
_frame_mod.pa = _pa
```

Then re-run the failing cell.
