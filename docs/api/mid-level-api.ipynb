    "\n",
    "This notebook's intent is to show you how the mid-level API of `nxviz`\n",
    "expresses a thought framework for drawing networks in a rational fashion.\n",
    "We start with a particular layout (positions) for the nodes,\n",
    "deciding on their grouping and ordering.\n",
    "We then declare their size, color, and transparency,\n",
    "based on data attributes that are present on there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we declare the way to draw edges.\n",
    "Each layout has its own particular idiomatic edge drawing method,\n",
    "and usually the easiest way to handle this is to use the corresponding edges function.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs that live at a higher level of abstraction usually imply more restrictions,\n",
    "as the intent here is usually to trade off customizable details for simplicity.\n",
    "The mid-level API allows us to gain finer-grained control over plots while remaining declarative.\n",
    "Changing the colormap, in particular, is out of scope for the mid-level API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The highest level of the `nxviz` API is object-based\n",
    "and opinionatedly pairs certain node layouts with certain edge drawing functions,\n",
    "not allowing for any customization there.\n",
    "The lowest-level API is where one interacts with the lines, layouts, positions directly,\n",
    "exposing more direct interaction with `matplotlib`."
