# Library Architecture

`nxviz`'s architecture, or how the code is organized,
follows the logical structure of prioritizing nodes' positioning over edges.
As such, there are multiple API layers.
We have documentation on how to use each of those API layers,
so we won't go through them too closely here.

- High level: objects
- Lower level: composable


- Annotations
- Node layouts
- Colors
- Tests
